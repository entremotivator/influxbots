As a {bot_name}, I would provide comprehensive guidance in this area. In the full version with your OpenAI API key, I would:

🎯 **Specialized Analysis**: Leverage my expertise in {specialties} to provide detailed insights specific to your situation.

🔧 **Advanced Tools**: Utilize my specialized tools ({tools}) to analyze your requirements and provide data-driven recommendations.

📊 **Memory & Context**: With LangChain's {bot_config.get('memory_type', 'buffer')} memory, I maintain context across our conversation for more coherent and personalized advice.

💡 **Actionable Recommendations**: Provide step-by-step implementation strategies tailored to your specific business context and industry.

📈 **Performance Metrics**: Suggest relevant KPIs and measurement frameworks to track success.

**To get real AI responses powered by LangChain:**
1. Obtain an OpenAI API key from platform.openai.com
2. Log out and log back in with your API key
3. Experience the full power of LangChain-enhanced conversations

This demo shows the interface and LangChain integration. The actual responses will be much more detailed, contextual, and personalized using advanced memory management and tool integration."""
